# DATA VISUALISATION PROJECT PROPOSAL: THE LINK BETWEEN TEENAGE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE

## Overview
In this project we will aim to look at the increased use of social media and the impact this has had on developing minds of teenagers. Since the sharp increase in usage of social media seen around 2008-2010, its effects on mental health have been a popular topic amongst parents, educators and researchers. We will analyse concrete data to see if their concerns are valid.

## Research Questions
1. What trends/shifts can be seen in teenage mental health (such as anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) in recent years? Is there any correlation with the increased social media engagement?
2. Are certain demographic factors (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, economic background) more or less prone to mental health illness due to increased social media usage?
3. Does type of social media content (e.g., entertainment, news, lifestyle, or peer interactions) relate to different mental health outcomes in teens?
4. Does the impact of social media differ between different age ranges (e.g. early teens vs. late teens)?
5. Are there any positive mental health effects caused by social media?

## Data Sources
To address these questions, we will use datasets from credible and reliable sources that provide both mental health statistics and social media usage patterns:
- **Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**: Offers comprehensive data on teenage mental health indicators, including prevalence rates of conditions like anxiety and depression.
- **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Provides global mental health statistics that allow for comparison across different regions and demographic groups.
- **Pew Research Center**: Publishes surveys and reports on social media usage trends, capturing data on time spent online, platform preferences, and engagement habits among teenagers.

## Project Goals
Our aim is to create strong visuals that increase awareness of the viewers around this subject area. We hope this work can serve as useful information for both academic and general audiences.
