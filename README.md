# Data Visualisation Project Proposal: The Link Between Teenage Mental Health Issues and Social Media Usage

### Overview  

In this project, we aim to explore the increased use of social media and its impact on the developing minds of teenagers. Since the surge in social media usage around 2008-2010, its effects on mental health have sparked significant discussion among parents, educators, and researchers. Through this project, we will analyze concrete data to assess whether these concerns are substantiated.

### Research Questions
- **Trends in Teenage Mental Health**: What trends or shifts can be observed in teenage mental health (e.g., anxiety, depression, self-esteem) in recent years? Is there any correlation with increased social media engagement?
- **Demographic Factors**: Are specific demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, economic background) more or less prone to mental health issues related to social media usage?
- **Social Media Content Types**: Does the type of social media content (e.g., entertainment, news, lifestyle, peer interactions) correlate with different mental health outcomes in teens?
- **Age-Based Impact**: Does the impact of social media differ between early and late teens?
- **Positive Mental Health Effects**: Are there any positive mental health effects associated with social media usage?

### Data Sources
To answer these questions, we will rely on datasets from reliable sources providing both mental health statistics and social media usage patterns:
- **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**: Offers comprehensive data on teenage mental health indicators, including prevalence rates of anxiety and depression.
- **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Provides global mental health statistics, enabling comparisons across regions and demographics.
- **Pew Research Center**: Publishes surveys and reports on social media usage trends, capturing data on time spent online, platform preferences, and engagement habits among teenagers.

### Potential Statistical Techniques
- **Descriptive Statistics**  
  - *Purpose*: Provide a basic overview of the data.
  - *Methods*: Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, etc. (e.g., histograms, box plots)
  
- **Correlation Analysis**  
  - *Purpose*: Assess the relationship between social media usage and mental health indicators.
  - *Methods*: Multiple Regression Analysis (scatter plots)
  
- **Regression Analysis**  
  - *Purpose*: Explore the impact of social media usage on mental health.
  - *Methods*: Linear regression or logistic regression analysis (regression line plots)
  
- **Time Series Analysis**  
  - *Purpose*: Analyze changes in social media usage and mental health over time.
  - *Methods*: ARIMA models (line plots)
  
- **Cluster Analysis**  
  - *Purpose*: Identify groups of teenagers with similar social media usage patterns.
  - *Methods*: K-means clustering (cluster plots)

### Project Goals
Our goal is to create impactful visuals that raise awareness on this topic. We hope this project will serve as a valuable resource for both academic and general audiences.
